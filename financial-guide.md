### Financial Calculations Guide


1. **``COGS Calculation``:**
   - The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is computed as the product of unit price and quantity.
   - COGS = unitPrice * quantity

2. **``VAT Calculation``:**
   - VAT is determined as 5% of the COGS.
   - VAT = 5% * COGS
   - This VAT amount is added to the total and billed to the customer.

3. **`Total Sales (Gross Sales) Calculation`:**
   - Total sales or gross sales is the sum of VAT and COGS.
   - total (gross sales) = VAT + COGS

4. **`Gross Profit (Gross Income) Calculation`:**
   - Gross profit (or gross income) is derived by subtracting COGS from the total sales.
   - grossProfit (gross income) = total (gross sales) - COGS

5. **`Gross Margin Percentage Calculation`:**
   - Gross Margin is expressed as a percentage of the total revenue.
   - Gross Margin Percentage = gross income / total revenue

*Example with sample data:*

Given data:
  - Unit Price = ₹10

  - Quantity = 15

Calculations : 
  - `COGS` = Unit Price * Quantity = ₹10 * 15 = ₹150

  - `VAT` = 8% * COGS = 8% * ₹150 = ₹12

  - `Total` = VAT + COGS = ₹12 + ₹150 = ₹162

  - `Gross Margin Percentage` = Gross Income / Total Revenue = ₹12 / $162 ≈ 7.41%
